        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Amiya Patley. I am from India. 
        I have many hobbies which include reading books, writing, singing and travelling. I graduated high school with legal studies as my major and even got into <strong> Top 5<sup>th</sup> National Law University </strong> of India but I changed the path of my life to pursue my true passion: web designing. </p>
        <p> I love animals. As a child, I grew immense love towards delicate animals and loved to take care of them. I used to own a pet parrot but he flew away, now I own a three year old cultured Pomeranian!! His name is Kiwi <em>(inspired by his brownish fur)</em>. Living alone in Canada has been a rollercoaster of a jorney for me so far but being apart from my pet had been even more challenging. I wish he'd come here as well. </p>
